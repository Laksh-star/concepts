# SimulDx Whitepaper

**Title:** SimulDx: A Visual Diagnostic Twin Framework for Safe, Fast, and Cost-Effective Clinical Reasoning  
**Author:** LN U  
**Date:** July 2025

## 📄 Abstract

**SimulDx** introduces a novel visual diagnostic twin framework—a virtual patient avatar that simulates clinical reasoning using AI panels and virtual tests. It enables clinicians, educators, and researchers to simulate diagnostics and treatments in a safe, fast, and cost-effective sandbox before applying them in the real world.

This whitepaper presents the system’s architecture, key components, motivations, and use cases. It explores how SimulDx can augment current AI diagnostic systems with interactive, explainable, and visual reasoning tools.

## 🖼️ System Overview

SimulDx is composed of:

- **Visual Avatar Engine**: Simulated patient interface  
- **Virtual Test Interface**: Simulated labs and imaging  
- **AI Reasoning Core**: Multi-agent diagnostic logic (e.g., Dr. Hypothesis, Dr. Stewardship)  
- **Outcome Simulation Module**: Simulated treatments and outcome projection
